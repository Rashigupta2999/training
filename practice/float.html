            A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants 
        (plants of the division Angiospermae). The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, 
        usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs.There are two types of pollination: self-pollination 
        and cross-pollination. Self-pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same 
        flower, or another flower on the same plant. Cross-pollination is when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower 
        to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happens in flowers 
        where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's 
        stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.
        Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site 
        where gametophytes develop. The androecium, or stamens, is the whorl of pollen producing male parts. Stamens consist
        typically of an anther, made up of four pollen sacs arranged in two thecae, connected to a filament, or stalk.

        typically of an anther, made up of four pollen sacs arranged in two thecae, connected to a filament, or stalk. 
        The anther contains microsporocytes which become pollen, the male gametophyte, after undergoing meiosis. Although 
        they exhibit the widest variation among floral organs, the androecium is usually confined just to one whorl and 
        to two whorls only in rare cases. Stamens range in number, size, shape, orientation, and in their point of 
        connection to the flower.Gynoecium The gynoecium, or the carpels, is the female part of the flower found on the i
        nnermost whorl. Each carpel consists of a stigma, which receives pollen, a style, which acts as a stalk, and 
        an ovary, which contains the ovules. Carpels may occur in one to several whorls, and when fused together are 
        often described as a pistil. Inside the ovary, the ovules are suspended off of pieces of tissue called placenta.
